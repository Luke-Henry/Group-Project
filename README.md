Web Application - A Localized Course Discussion Board for students of Maynooth University
___________________

This is an organizational application that allows Maynooth students to keep track of their assignments and lab work. It also provides a localized forum where students can assist one another and collaborate on common assignments. The goal was to allow students to plan out their assignments and track their respective due dates, as well as to provide a simpler, easily accessible and less intimidating environment for students to discuss assignments than is provided by Moodle (the official course discussion forum provided by Maynooth University).

I was responsible for all back-end development. I chose to use Node.js and Google's Firebase Realtime Database for this task.
This involved the creation of functions for user authentication and authorization, listeners to load new content in real time, and the storing, fetching and comparison of JavaScript Date objects to manage the application's 'Due Date' functionality.

I was also involved in the implementation of a JavaScript search function and in automating the testing of the front end interface via Selenium.
